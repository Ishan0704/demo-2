# DEMO-2 REPO
This is my second demo repo which created from scratch from using local machine and updated in GitHub <br>
In this repo I first created a repo (without README.md) and kept empty on origin. then performed following tasks<br> 
1. I created another directory titled "New-demo-repo" on local machine using command "mkdir New-demo-repo"<br>
2. Used command **git remote add origin https://github.com/Ishan0704/demo-2"** to make same directory on origin<br>
3. Next add and commit sample.html and README.md on origin<br>
4. Updated README.md using VS Code and push it to origin
